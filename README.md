System Design & Development:
Designed and programmed a traffic light system using C++ and Arduino to replicate real-world traffic flow patterns.
Configured LED lights to represent red, yellow, and green signals with realistic timing cycles.

Timing Control Implementation:
Established timing controls with a 15-second red light, 20-second green light, and blinking yellow transitions for smoother light changes.
Incorporated delays and sequential logic to simulate real traffic signal timing.

Logic and Control Flow:
Utilized condition-based logic to manage light transitions accurately.
Structured the code to ensure consistent and error-free operation of each traffic phase.

Hardware Integration:
Connected LEDs to Arduino pins with proper circuit interfacing for reliable hardware performance.
Optimized the circuit design for durability and scalability in simulation setups.

Continuous Operation:
Designed the system for continuous looping to mimic an ongoing traffic cycle, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted operation.
